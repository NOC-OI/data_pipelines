Annex I reefs occur where rocky areas or concretions made by marine animals arise from the surrounding seafloor. Version 8.1 of the dataset was produced by removing a single map (GB000980) from the previous version (2019 V8). Version 8.2 of the dataset was produced by correcting polygon errors in Rockall Reef from the previous version (2021 V8.1). Version 8.3 of the dataset was produced by updating data availability restrictions, addressing overlapping polygons in the Shetland Islands, removing specific points following updated advice and correcting a GUI following updated advice from the previous version (2021 V8.2). Areas of protected reef can be viewed on the JNCC MPA Mapper: https://jncc.gov.uk/mpa-mapper.
