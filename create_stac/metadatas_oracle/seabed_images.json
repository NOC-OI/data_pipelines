The specific location of the Autosub6000 mission was chosen to correspond with an area of ship-based seabed survey carried out from the RV Cefas Endeavour just prior to the arrival of RRS Discovery cruise 377/8. \n This photographic survey was the first in a series of surveys conducted in the same location with a camera mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle, conducted when the Greater Haig Fras area was under consideration for MCZ status.
